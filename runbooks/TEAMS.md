# Teams

Org-level user management: one organisation per user, invitations by email, and three org
roles. Off by default behind `TEAMS_ENABLED`.

---

## 1. What Billet ships

| Route | Methods | Minimum org role | With the flag off |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/team` | GET, POST | GET/POST need auth; the management view needs `admin` | 404 |
| `/team/invites` | POST | `admin` | 404 |
| `/team/invites/:id/revoke` | POST | `admin` | 404 |
| `/team/members/:id/role` | POST | `admin` (`owner` to touch ownership) | 404 |
| `/team/members/:id/remove` | POST | `admin` (`owner` to remove an owner) | 404 |
| `/invites/accept` | GET, POST | none — the acceptor has no membership yet | 404 |

Routes are registered unconditionally in `src/server/routes/app.tsx`; each controller calls
`render404()` when `!teamsEnabled()`. A route existing tells you nothing about whether it answers
— the same contract the password-mode routes follow.

Schema is migration `008_add_organizations.ts`: an `organizations` table, an
`organization_members` table, and an `organization_invites` table. The migration runs in every
fork; with the flag off nothing writes to any of them.

**It alters no existing table.** That is a hard rule for this feature, not an accident of the
design — see §9.

---

## 2. The two role axes

`users.role` is `'user' | 'admin'`. It means **platform operator**, it gates `/admin` through
`requireAdmin`, and this feature does not touch it.

`organization_members.org_role` is `'owner' | 'admin' | 'member'`. It means **standing inside one
organisation**, and it gates `/team` through `requireOrgRole`.

They are deliberately not merged. A platform operator answering a support ticket is not thereby
an owner of a customer's organisation, and collapsing the two would make every support grant a
data grant. Concretely: widening the `users_role_check` constraint to hold org roles would make
"org owner who is not a platform admin" — the single most common user of this feature —
inexpressible.

The form field is named `org_role`, never `role`, so a copy-paste can never write a member's
input into `users.role` and hand them the admin console. The two axes also live in two different
tables, so a query against one cannot accidentally return the other.

---

## 3. Turning it on

`TEAMS_ENABLED=true`. Anything other than `true` or `false` stops the server at boot, unlike
`CAPTCHA_ENABLED` — a typo here would silently 404 the whole surface, and an owner hitting a 404
on their own team page reads that as a bug rather than as a mode.

`teamsEnabled()` reads `process.env` on every call, so a test can flip it between cases.

**Enabling it over an existing database backfills nothing.** Every current user has no
membership row and lands on the "create a team" empty state. That is deliberate: guessing that
each existing user should get a personal org would be wrong for most forks and awkward to undo.

**The test preload pins `TEAMS_ENABLED=false`** in `src/server/test-utils/test-env.ts`, alongside
`SESSION_COOKIE_NAME`, `AUTH_MODE`, `CAPTCHA_ENABLED` and the rest of the test environment.
Without the pin, a developer who runs the dev server with teams on leaks it into every test run
and every `expect(404)` on a team route stops holding. Files exercising teams set it per-case, at
runtime — preload has long since finished by then.

### How anyone finds `/team`

It is in no navigation — not the nav bar, and `/admin` isn't either. Two paths lead to it, and
with the flag off neither exists:

- **Signing in with no membership lands on `/team`** rather than `/`, via `landingAfterAuth` in
  `src/server/controllers/auth/landing.ts`. All four paths that establish a session go through it:
  `callback` (magic-link sign-in *and* sign-up), `login.create`, `signup.create`, and the password
  reset, which completes as a sign-in. It checks `teamsEnabled()` before querying — `/team` 404s
  with the flag off, so without that guard every fork that never turned teams on would send every
  sign-in to a dead page.
- **`/account` names your team** and links to `/team` when you can manage it.

This fires on every sign-in, not only the first: "no team yet" is the state the feature exists to
get you out of, and being in a team makes it stop. A fork that wants it once-only needs a marker
of its own — there is no "first login" flag to read.

---

## 4. Invitations

An invite is a row in `organization_invites` carrying the org, the address, the role it grants,
and an HMAC of a 32-byte token. Only the hash is stored — the raw value exists solely in the
email.

- **Lifetime: 7 days**, longer than any auth token. An invite grants org membership rather than
  a session or account takeover, it goes to someone who may be away, and unlike the auth tokens
  it can be revoked — so a long life is not an uncancellable one. Expiry is filtered at read
  time, not swept.
- **Single use**, claimed by one `UPDATE ... WHERE accepted_at IS NULL ... RETURNING`. Two
  concurrent clicks: exactly one wins.
- **Re-inviting is idempotent** — any live invite for that address is revoked and a fresh one
  issued in the same call, so a double-click produces a new working link, not an error. A partial
  unique index enforces at most one live invite per address per org.
- **Revoking an invite** and **removing a member** are separate operations on separate tables;
  both are scoped by `organization_id`.
- **Capped at 50 live invites per org**, and rate limited at 5/minute per IP. Invite creation is
  a mail-sending primitive exposed to authenticated users; a compromised owner account must not
  become a spam relay from your verified domain (see [EMAIL.md](EMAIL.md)).

### Why invites are not `user_tokens`

`user_tokens` is the generic single-use emailed-token table and its `type` column is
unconstrained, so an `org_invite` type looks like the obvious reuse. It was rejected.

`user_tokens.user_id` is `NOT NULL`, so an invite to an address with no account would have to
create a shell `users` row first. `findOrCreateUser` already does that for any address typed into
the magic-link login form — but it has exactly one production call site, `createMagicLink`, so in
**password mode nothing today lets a third party create a passwordless user row**. And
`signInWithPassword` reports `no-password` distinguishably from `invalid-credentials`, a
disclosure scoped to accounts carried over from magic-link mode. Minting shell rows from an
invite box would widen it to *any address an org admin ever typed*, turning `/login` into an
oracle for "this address was invited to something once".

Two lesser reasons: `consumeUserToken` returns a `user_id` and nothing else, so the org and role
have nowhere to live; and revoking would leave a permanent shell row behind.

### The address binding

An invite is bound to the address it was sent to. Accepting while signed in as **anyone else**
fails with `email-mismatch`, checked before the token is spent. Without it, forwarding the link
turns it into a join-anyone link. This is the single most important check in the accept flow.

### Accepting, in both auth modes

`GET /invites/accept` never consumes the token — it renders the team name and, in password mode,
decides whether to ask for a password. That decision is keyed on the **invited address**, not the
session, because most people accept while signed out.

- **Magic-link mode** — the emailed token is the credential, exactly as a magic link is, so
  accepting signs them in. The session is regenerated, never reused.
- **Password mode, new or passwordless account** — they choose a password in the same request
  and are signed in. The password is validated *before* the invite is consumed, so a typo doesn't
  burn a single-use token.
- **Password mode, existing password account** — they become a member but are **not** signed in;
  they're sent to `/login`. Control of a mailbox is grounds for a *reset*, never a sign-in, which
  is exactly why `/auth/verify` signs nobody in. An invite must not become a way around that.

Accepting sets `email_verified_at` in both modes: the token only ever reached a mailbox the
recipient could open.

A new member lands on `/` with a success message, not on `/team` — they join below the `admin`
minimum that page requires, so the guard would only bounce them. A refused accept that leaves the
token unspent goes back to the link itself, where the GET explains the mismatch and offers the
sign-out that resolves it.

A URL with nothing live behind it — no token, an unknown one, a spent one — **renders** the
"Invitation unavailable" page rather than redirecting. `/invites/accept` is where a refused POST
is sent, so a redirect on that path would point at itself and loop until the browser or the rate
limiter gave up.

The form is guarded by `guardAuthForm`, exactly like `/login` and `/signup`, so with
`CAPTCHA_ENABLED=true` it renders the widget on **every** rendering. Gating it on "does this
invitee need a password" would leave magic-link mode — where nobody ever does — serving a form
whose POST the guard always rejects.

---

## 5. The last-owner invariant

An org must always have at least one owner. This is a **guard, not a constraint** — SQL can
express *at most* one of something via a partial unique index, which is the opposite of what is
needed.

The guard lives **inside** the statement — the `UPDATE` in `updateMemberRole`, the `DELETE` in
`removeMember` — and it locks the owner rows before it reads them:

```sql
WITH owners AS (
  SELECT user_id FROM organization_members
  WHERE organization_id = $1 AND org_role = 'owner'
  ORDER BY user_id
  FOR UPDATE
)
… AND (org_role <> 'owner' OR EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM owners WHERE user_id <> $2))
```

Zero rows back means it was refused.

**The `FOR UPDATE` is the guard.** Being inside one statement is not enough on its own: a bare
`EXISTS` subquery is still a check-then-write, because under Postgres's default READ COMMITTED each
of two concurrent removals sees the *other* owner — neither has committed — so both pass and both
commit, leaving the org with no owner. An org *admin* can still recover it — every team route gates
on `admin`, and an admin can promote someone to owner — but an org whose only admin-or-above members
were those two owners has no way back. That is write skew, and row-level
locking doesn't prevent it, because the two statements touch different rows. It shipped that way
until it was caught by running the suite in parallel; against the unlocked statement, 24 of 25
concurrent attempts empty the org.

Locking the owner rows first is what closes it. The second caller waits, and once the first commits
its `FOR UPDATE` re-checks and drops the row that went away — so it sees one owner, fails the guard,
and is refused. `ORDER BY user_id` fixes the lock order so two callers can't deadlock.

The template also hides the control on the last owner's row — but **that is cosmetic**. The
server decides. If you add a new path to change roles, it must go through these functions.

---

## 6. Authorisation checklist for new team routes

1. Open the controller method with `if (!teamsEnabled()) return render404();`. `requireOrgRole`
   repeats the check as a backstop, but the line at the top is what a reader sees.
2. Call `requireOrgRole(req, minimum)` and return `result.response` when it refuses.
3. **Scope every `:id` lookup by the caller's org** — `WHERE user_id = $1 AND organization_id = $2`,
   never by id alone. The guard proves you administer *an* org, not that the row you named is in it. Nothing
   else in the codebase catches this; it is the one authorisation bug class this feature adds.
4. Resolve not-found to a flash and a redirect, never a 404 — so "wrong org" and "already gone"
   stay indistinguishable.
5. Check body-dependent escalation (granting `owner`) against `result.membership.role`, in the
   controller. The guard can't: whether a POST is a promotion is only knowable after reading the
   body.
6. Give every form its own CSRF token. Tokens are bound to method **and** path, so a table of
   rows needs one per row — see `team.index` for the pattern.

---

## 7. Scoping your own data by org

Core stops at identity. `requireOrgRole` returns the resolved membership, so
`result.membership.org.id` is available in every guarded controller — that is the seam.

```ts
const guard = await requireOrgRole(req, "member");
if (!guard.authorized) return guard.response;

const invoices = await listInvoices(guard.membership.org.id);
```

For a page outside the team surface, call `getMembership(userId)` directly.

To scope a table of your own: add `org_id UUID REFERENCES organizations(id)` in a new migration,
put it in the `WHERE` clause of every read *and* every write, and add the table to
`cleanupTestData`. Scope in the service, not the controller — a query that can be called without
the predicate eventually will be.

---

## 8. Deliberately not shipped, and why

- **Core does not scope domain data by org.** The `project` table has no `org_id` and
  `services/project.ts` is untouched. What "belongs to" an org is product-specific — some rows
  are per-user, some per-org, some global — so a guessed column on the example table would be
  wrong for most forks and load-bearing enough that removing it is worse than adding it. Use the
  seam in §7.
- **No multi-org membership and no org switcher.** One user, one org. Multi-org means a switcher,
  a current-org value on the session, and re-scoping every query — a different feature. The
  one-org rule is enforced by the `UNIQUE` on `organization_members.user_id`, which
  `joinOrganization` and `createOrganizationForUser` read as an answer rather than an error.
- **No read-only roster for plain members.** `/team` requires `admin`. Lower the minimum at the
  call site and branch the template if your product wants one.
- **No changing your own role.** Both self-actions are somebody else's to take. The upward case
  was already blocked — only an owner grants ownership — so the only self-change the roles allowed
  was a *demotion*, which drops you below the `admin` minimum `/team` requires and leaves you
  unable to undo it. An owner stepping down promotes their successor first and is demoted by them.
  The row renders a badge instead of the select, and `teamMembers.updateRole` refuses it.
- **No leaving a team.** Removal is something another owner or admin does to you; the members
  table hides `Remove` on your own row and `teamMembers.destroy` refuses it, so the two agree.
  A member who left would land on a `/team` they can no longer load, and with one org per user
  they would have no way back without a fresh invitation — that is a flow to design, not a
  side effect of the remove button.
- **No ownership transfer as a single action.** An owner can promote another owner, but there is
  no atomic "transfer and go", and no going.
- **No `?next=` on `/login`.** A signed-out invitee is told to sign in and re-open the link. A
  post-login redirect parameter is an open-redirect footgun and would touch the auth flow
  directly; a fork adding one must allowlist paths rather than accept arbitrary URLs.
- **No audit log.** Role changes and removals aren't recorded beyond application logs.
- **No seat limits, billing, SSO, SCIM, nested teams, or custom permission sets.**

## 9. Removing the feature

A fork that will never use teams should be able to drop it without writing a migration against
its own account data, so **migration `008` creates three tables and alters none**. Membership is a
row in `organization_members` with a `UNIQUE` `user_id`, not `org_id` / `org_role` /
`org_joined_at` columns on `users`.

The unique index is what makes that free rather than a trade: one org per user stays structural,
and because the org, the role and the join date are one row, "half a membership" is unrepresentable
— the state a three-column `CHECK` would otherwise have to forbid.

Never move any of it onto `users`. The columns would be marginally fewer joins and would hand
every fork an `ALTER TABLE users DROP COLUMN` to write and get right against live accounts.

To remove it:

1. Delete `src/server/services/organizations.ts`, `invites.ts`, `teams-mode.ts`,
   `middleware/org.ts`, `controllers/team/`, `controllers/auth/landing.ts`,
   `templates/team.tsx`, `templates/accept-invite.tsx`, and their tests.
2. Drop the team routes from `src/server/routes/app.tsx` and the `TEAMS_ENABLED` case from
   `utils/env.ts`.
3. **Untangle the five references outside the team surface.** These are the ones that don't
   announce themselves, because nothing about their filename says "teams":
   - `controllers/auth/callback.tsx`, `login.tsx`, `signup.tsx` and `password-reset.tsx` each end
     a successful sign-in with `redirect(await landingAfterAuth(user.id))`. Put `"/"` back.
   - `controllers/auth/account.tsx` renders the Team section — drop the `getMembership` /
     `atLeast` / `teamsEnabled` imports, the `membership` lookup, and the `team` prop.
   - `templates/account.tsx` — drop the `team` prop and the section that renders it.
   - `controllers/auth/account.test.ts` and `callback.test.ts` both import from
     `services/organizations`; their team cases go with it.
   - `services/cleanup.ts` sweeps expired invites alongside the auth tables — drop the
     `cleanupExpiredInvites` / `teamsEnabled` imports and the guarded call, and the invite cases
     in `cleanup.test.ts`. The rest of the sweep is core and stays.
4. For the schema: if the fork has not run `008` yet, delete the migration file. If it has, run its
   `down` — three `DROP TABLE`s, no statement of which can reach a `users` row. Either way `users`
   ends up exactly as migration `007` left it.
5. Remove the three `TRUNCATE`s from `cleanupTestData` and the `TEAMS_ENABLED` pin from
   `run-tests.ts`.

`bun run check` is what confirms you got step 3 right — every missed reference is an unresolved
import, not a silent behaviour change.

`organizations.test.ts` asserts `users` has no `org_id`, `org_role` or `org_joined_at` column, so a
change that reintroduces one fails the suite rather than quietly costing every fork a migration.

---

## 10. How to verify

With `TEAMS_ENABLED=true`:

1. Sign up. You land on `/team` rather than `/`, because you have no membership. Create a team —
   you're the owner. Sign out and back in: now you land on `/`.
2. Invite an address; read the link from the console email provider's log; open it in a private
   window and accept. The member appears with the role you granted.
3. Sign in as a plain `member` and open `/team` — you're redirected to `/` with a message, not
   shown the page and not 404'd.
4. Your own row shows a badge, never a role select or a Remove link — as an owner, and again as an
   admin with an owner above you. Post to `/team/members/:id/role` and `/team/members/:id/remove`
   with your own id and valid tokens to confirm the *server* refuses both, not just the hidden
   controls.
5. Take a member id from another org and post it to your own org's role endpoint. Nothing changes.
6. Forward an invite link and open it while signed in as someone else. It must refuse.
7. Repeat step 2 with `AUTH_MODE=password`, twice: once for an address with no account (it asks
   for a password and signs them in) and once for an address that already has one (it joins them
   and sends them to `/login` **without** a session).
8. Open `/invites/accept` with no token, and again with a spent one. Both render "Invitation
   unavailable" — a redirect here lands back on the same URL.
9. Repeat step 2 with `CAPTCHA_ENABLED=true` in both auth modes. The accept form shows the
   captcha and the acceptance goes through; the widget is not a password-mode thing.
10. Unset the flag: `/team` and `/invites/accept` 404, sign-in lands on `/` again for everyone
    including users with no membership, `/account` shows no Team section, and nothing else
    changes. The sign-in check is the one that matters — a redirect to a 404 would break every
    fork that never turned teams on.
