# CLAUDE.md

Billet is a server-rendered full-stack TypeScript app on Bun + PostgreSQL. Requests flow
route → controller → service → template. `README.md` has the directory tree; the code is the
spec for everything else. This file is for the things you can't learn by reading the repo.

## Working agreements

- The dev server is already running in another tab, on this workspace's own port — don't start
  one, and don't add a second. `bun run dev` here will fail on the port or fight the watcher.
  Read `PORT` from `.env` rather than assuming 3000; only the root checkout is on 3000.
- Run test and lint suites through the `package.json` scripts (`bun run test`, `bun run check`).
  Invoking `bun test` directly skips migrations, so it runs against whatever schema is already
  there — see the `verifying-changes` skill. The test environment itself is safe either way; it
  is pinned by a preload, not by the runner.
- Write code that reads like the surrounding code: match its comment density, naming, and idiom.
- When you try several approaches to a problem, delete the ones you abandoned before you finish.
- Check work in the browser with the `/browse` skill when the change is user-visible.
- Never `git stash`. Use `bun run wip` — see "The stash is shared, the worktrees are not".

## Gotchas

### The stash is shared, the worktrees are not

This repo is usually several worktrees over one shared `.git`, and `refs/stash` lives in the
shared part — one global stack, so an agent that pops can silently take another agent's work.
`bun run wip` (`scripts/wip`) is the replacement: it snapshots to `refs/worktree/wip`, the one ref
namespace git keeps per-worktree. Run it bare for the subcommand list (`save`, `stash`, `list`,
`show`, `restore`, `drop`); `restore` applies without dropping, and untracked files are never
touched. A `PreToolUse` hook denies `git stash` and prints that same table; `git stash create` and
anything naming `refs/worktree/` pass through — that is how `scripts/wip` works.

### Each workspace owns its port and its two databases

`scripts/workspace.ts provision` (run by Conductor setup) rewrites this workspace's `.env` —
`PORT`/`APP_URL` from `CONDUCTOR_PORT`, a `DATABASE_URL` named `<base>-<workspace>`, a
workspace-specific `SESSION_COOKIE_NAME` — and gives `.env.test` its own `DATABASE_URL`, because
`cleanupTestData` truncates every table and two agents sharing one test database fail each other's
suites in ways neither can reproduce. A workspace port must never reach the tests: they hardcode
`http://localhost:3000` and build the expected CSRF Origin from `APP_URL`. `provision` is
idempotent (the base name comes from the root checkout's `.env`); `destroy` refuses to drop a
database that doesn't carry this workspace's slug. Both no-op in cloud workspaces.

### The dev database is shared with whoever has the browser open

One workspace, one `DATABASE_URL` — the rows an agent writes are the rows a person is signed in
against. So the obvious way to check an admin screen (mint a session for `admin@example.com`, drive
the page, then `DELETE FROM sessions WHERE user_id = (SELECT id FROM users WHERE email =
'admin@example.com')`) logs the developer out mid-session, with nothing on screen to explain it. It
reads as session expiry or a pool fault; it is neither, and it repeats every verification pass.

`scripts/qa-session.ts` is the replacement, and the rule is to use it rather than remember the
hazard. It mints a session for a QA account of its own and prints the `Cookie` header:

```
bun run scripts/qa-session.ts                    # platform user
bun run scripts/qa-session.ts --role=admin       # platform admin, for /admin
bun run scripts/qa-session.ts --org-role=owner   # org owner, for /team
bun run scripts/qa-session.ts --clean            # delete every QA session
```

The two flags are the two role axes and stay separate, so "org owner who is not a platform admin"
— the case worth verifying — is expressible. Each combination is its own account named after
itself (`qa-agent-admin-member@example.com`), so minting one never mutates a role out from under a
session another still holds; org roles share one `QA` organisation, which is what makes an owner
and a member comparable on the same page. It refuses to run under `NODE_ENV=production` —
creating a platform admin on demand at an address the operator doesn't control is the hole
`seedIfEmpty` avoids by only touching an empty database. None of these accounts are in the seed,
so a developer who never runs an agent never sees the rows.

`DELETE FROM sessions` without a `user_id` predicate is never right here. Neither is reading the
human's cookie out of their browser instead of minting one: it works, and it makes the agent's
requests indistinguishable from the developer's in the logs.

### One JSX runtime, two execution models

Everything compiles with Preact (`jsxImportSource: preact` in `tsconfig.json`) — there is no React
in this project. What differs is *when* the JSX runs, and the `src/server/` vs `src/client/` split
is the signal:

- **`src/server/`** renders once through `renderToString()` from `preact-render-to-string` and ships
  as HTML. It never hydrates, so `useState` in a server template does nothing.
- **`src/client/`** mounts into the live DOM with `render()` from `preact` and is fully interactive.

`preact` is a runtime **dependency**, not a devDependency — the server imports its JSX runtime, so a
production install without it won't boot. The client bundle marks it `--external` and resolves it
from the import map in `src/server/components/layouts.tsx`, so the version pinned there must stay in
step with `package.json`.

The import map carries **both** `preact/jsx-runtime` and `preact/jsx-dev-runtime`, and both are
`--external` in the client build. Neither is dead weight. Bun 1.4 documents `"jsx": "react-jsx"` as
emitting `jsx` from `<pkg>/jsx-runtime`, but the mere presence of a `bunfig.toml` — any content, even
empty — makes it emit `jsxDEV` from `<pkg>/jsx-dev-runtime` instead. This repo has one, so the
bundle and the server both use the dev runtime. Reproduce it by deleting `bunfig.toml` and
rebuilding; the import changes. Whichever way Bun settles this, both entries are mapped, so nothing
breaks — which is the only reason it isn't a live bug here. Don't prune the "unused" one.

**Write SVG attributes in kebab-case** (`stroke-width`, not `strokeWidth`). Preact passes camelCase
attribute names through verbatim, and the HTML parser doesn't recognise `strokeWidth` — the stroke
silently renders at the default width. React used to rewrite these; nothing does now.

No Web Components. Shadow DOM and custom-element lifecycles need browser infrastructure to test;
pure functions and Preact islands are both testable under `bun:test`.

### Service tests mock the DB module before importing the service

`src/server/services/*.test.ts` call `mock.module("./database", ...)` and *then* import the
service under test. The imports sit below executable code on purpose — that ordering is what
makes the mock take effect. Don't tidy it.

### The test runner is a script, not `bun test`

`bun run test` runs `src/server/test-utils/run-tests.ts` for the two things `bun test` won't do
itself: apply migrations first, and set `NODE_ENV=test` (Bun picks its `.env` file from it before
any preload runs). Isolation is `bun test --isolate`'s job — fresh globals and module registries
per file, one shared transpile cache — and `--parallel` runs one worker per core, each with its
own database derived from `BUN_TEST_WORKER_ID` (slot 1 keeps the base name, so single-worker runs
and `test:file` use the database they always did). `TEST_WORKERS=1` when a failure needs a
readable, ordered log. Full mechanics: the `verifying-changes` skill.

Module-level state is the hazard isolation doesn't excuse: `rate-limit.ts`'s `requestLog` Map is
shared by every file in a process, so a file exercising a rate-limited route must call
`clearRateLimitLog()` in `beforeEach` or it passes alone and fails after any file that drove the
limiter to 429.

`run-tests.ts` sweeps only the paths in its `TEST_PATHS`, which is `["src"]`. A test under
`scripts/` never runs in CI unless it is named there — `scripts/browser-smoke.test.ts` is
deliberately out, because it needs a built bundle and a listening server, and runs through
`bun run test:browser`. Add opted-in files by name; a widened glob would drag the smoke test in.

### Every test file's database connection comes from `testDatabase()`

Service and controller tests `mock.module` the database module with their own `SQL` instance, so
every test file owns a pool. `new SQL(url)` with no options takes Bun's default max of **10**, and
`--parallel` runs one file per core — ten cores is up to 100 connections against a server whose
`max_connections` is typically 100, with the dev server already holding 10. Past the line Postgres
answers `sorry, too many clients already` (SQLSTATE 53300) to whichever file happened to be
connecting, so the failure names an innocent file and the next run is green. It has been
misdiagnosed as agent contention and as a flaky auth controller.

`testDatabase()` (`src/server/test-utils/database.ts`) is the only way to build one: it caps the
pool at 3 and does the `DATABASE_URL` check. Three, not one — a test holding a reserved connection
(advisory lock, row lock, a `begin()` that also reads outside the transaction) needs two at once,
and a pool of one deadlocks into a hang with no error. `database.test.ts` fails the suite if any
test file calls `new SQL(` directly. Don't fix a connection-exhaustion failure by lowering
`TEST_WORKERS`: that costs parallelism, hides the cause, and the next test file re-adds ten
connections.

### Three Bun.SQL behaviours that fail silently

- **`expect(query).rejects` hangs instead of failing.** A `Bun.SQL` tagged template is a lazy
  thenable, not a promise, so `.rejects` never resolves and the file times out with no failing
  assertion to point at. Wrap it in an async IIFE:
  `await expect((async () => { await sql`…` })()).rejects.toThrow(…)`.
- **`= ANY(${array})` is wrong, not an error.** A JS array bound into `ANY()` serialises to a
  comma-joined string (`malformed array literal: "a,b"`), and `sql.array()` double-quotes each
  element so `['A']` arrives as `"A"` with the quotes inside the value. Use `IN ${sql(array)}`. For
  a `text[]` *column*, build the Postgres array literal by hand.
- **Bun JSON-encodes a value bound to a `jsonb` column itself.** `${JSON.stringify(obj)}` therefore
  stores a jsonb *string* — one long scalar that reads back as text and matches no query, with no
  error at any layer. Bind the object directly.

### One preload sets the test environment

`bunfig.toml` preloads `src/server/test-utils/test-env.ts`, which pins the whole test environment
(`SESSION_COOKIE_NAME`, `AUTH_MODE`, `CAPTCHA_ENABLED`, `TEAMS_ENABLED`, `TRUST_PROXY`, `PORT`,
`APP_URL`, `CRYPTO_PEPPER`, email/app names), and `src/client/test-utils/setup.ts`, which registers
happy-dom globals and then restores Bun's native `Request`/`Response`/`FormData` — but **not**
`fetch`: happy-dom's fetch stays installed and enforces the Same-Origin Policy, so a test that
needs real network must use `Bun.fetch`.

A preload is the only place early enough: imports are hoisted above a file's body, so values
captured at import time (`SESSION_COOKIE_NAME` in `services/sessions.ts`, `CRYPTO_PEPPER` in
`utils/crypto.ts`) are already read before a test's first line runs. `.env.test` carries
`DATABASE_URL` and nothing else — anything else you put there is overridden. Tests that exercise
password mode, the captcha, or teams set the variable per case, at runtime.

### Auth is one mode or the other, never both

`AUTH_MODE` (`src/server/services/auth-mode.ts`) is `magic-link` (default) or `password`. The two
are mutually exclusive on purpose. `/forgot-password`, `/reset-password`, `/account/password`,
and `/auth/verify*` all `render404()` from inside their controllers when the mode is wrong — the
route table in `routes/app.tsx` is static, so a route existing tells you nothing about whether it
answers. `/login`, `/signup`, and `/account` exist in both modes and branch on
`passwordAuthEnabled()`.

`authMode()` reads `process.env` on every call so tests can flip it mid-file; an invalid value is
fatal at boot in `validateEnv()`.

Every emailed link renders a confirm step on `GET` and spends its token on `POST` — mail security
scanners fetch each link they deliver, and a `GET` that redeemed would burn the token before the
recipient clicked. `runbooks/EMAIL.md` has the rule and the reason `/auth/callback` is CSRF-checked
while `/auth/verify` deliberately isn't.

### Two role axes, and they must never merge

`users.role` (`'user' | 'admin'`) is the **platform operator** flag. It gates `/admin` via
`requireAdmin` and nothing else touches it.

`organization_members.org_role` (`'owner' | 'admin' | 'member'`, migration `008`) is standing
inside **one organisation**, behind `TEAMS_ENABLED` (`src/server/services/teams-mode.ts`, a
boolean, fatal at boot on anything but `true`/`false`). It gates `/team` via `requireOrgRole`
(`src/server/middleware/org.ts`), which returns the resolved membership the way `requireAdmin`
returns the context.

Do not widen `users_role_check` to hold org roles: "org owner who is not a platform admin" is the
common case and merging the axes makes it inexpressible. Team forms name the field `org_role`,
never `role`, so a copy-paste can't write a member's input into the platform flag.

Migration `008` adds three tables and **alters nothing**. Membership is a row in
`organization_members` (`user_id` UNIQUE, so one org per user is structural) rather than columns on
`users`, because that is what makes the feature removable: a fork that doesn't want teams deletes
the migration and the team code, or runs `down` for three `DROP TABLE`s that cannot reach an
account row. Never add an org column to `users` — you would be handing every fork a migration to
write against live account data. Scope your own tables instead; `runbooks/TEAMS.md` has the seam.

Every `:id` in a team route is scoped `WHERE user_id = $1 AND organization_id = $2`. The guard
proves you administer *an* org, not that the row you named is in it — nothing else catches that.
The last-owner rule lives inside the `UPDATE`/`DELETE`, not around it; the hidden button is
cosmetic.

Core does not scope domain data by org — `runbooks/TEAMS.md` has the seam and the reasoning.

### Passwords are read raw, and never round-trip through flash state

`readFormValues` (`src/server/utils/form-data.ts`) trims values and drops empties — **unsafe for
credentials**, because whitespace is part of a password. Password controllers use `readPassword`
from `src/server/controllers/auth/form-guard.ts` instead, which reads the field verbatim.

Flash state is an HMAC-signed but client-readable cookie. A failed auth form preserves the email
address and nothing else. Never add a password to it.

Password hashing lives in `src/server/utils/crypto.ts` and is deliberately *not* peppered with
`CRYPTO_PEPPER`, unlike everything else in that file — see the comment there and `SECURITY.md`.

### Security headers and CSP are centralised

Every response gets its headers from `secureRoutes` / `handleGuarded` in
`src/server/utils/security-headers.ts`. Controllers set only content-specific headers.

The CSP script allowlist is `'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://unpkg.com https://esm.sh`. Any new
third-party script needs the CSP entry, an SRI `integrity` hash, and ideally a `preconnect` in
`layouts.tsx` — otherwise it is silently blocked in the browser but passes every test.

### An uncaught throw in an API controller becomes an *HTML* 500

`handleGuarded` catches everything and answers with `render500()` — the styled HTML error page —
whatever the route was. So a bare `await req.json()` on a malformed body sends an error page to a
JSON client and logs the request as a server fault, for what was the caller's typo.

`src/server/controllers/api/request-guard.ts` is the fix, and every `/api` controller opens with
it: `readJsonBody` (415 on the wrong `Content-Type`, 400 on unparseable or non-object),
`readIdParam`, `readPagination`, and `apiReadLimit` / `apiWriteLimit`. Errors go through
`jsonError` in `utils/response.ts` — one `{ error: { code, message } }` envelope, shared with the
rate limiter, with a stable `code` and a `message` no test should assert on.

API routes use `createApiRouteHandler`, not `createRouteHandler` — same method dispatch, JSON 405.
Both send `Allow`. Use it even for a one-method resource: a bare handler in a Bun routes map
answers *every* method.

### Env is validated at boot and `APP_URL` is load-bearing

`validateEnv()` exits the process on a missing var, then migrations run before `Bun.serve()` — a
failed migration means no server. `src/server/services/database.ts` throws at import time without
`DATABASE_URL`, so anything that imports it (directly or not) needs the env set.

`APP_URL` must include the port. CSRF origin validation compares the request `Origin` against it
exactly, so `http://localhost` vs `http://localhost:3000` rejects every form post with a 403.

### Assets are only fingerprinted in production

`initAssets()` and `getAssetUrl()` no-op unless `NODE_ENV=production`, so asset URLs differ between
dev and prod. In production the files must already exist in `dist/assets` or startup throws.

The un-hashed dev bundle is served by `serveDevBundle` (`src/server/utils/static-files.ts`), not
`serveFile`, and that distinction is load-bearing. `bun build --watch` rewrites `dist/assets/*` in
place, so a reload can read the file mid-write; `serveFile` would stream those zero bytes as a 200
carrying `max-age=3600`, and the stylesheet would stay missing for an hour. `serveDevBundle` reads
the whole file into memory, answers an empty read with a 503 + `Retry-After`, and sets `no-store`
throughout — so a mid-rebuild request costs one reload, never a cached blank.

A bundle that is *absent* rather than empty gets the same 503, not a 404: `handleFallback` checks
the name against `BUNDLE_FILENAMES` (`src/server/services/assets.ts`), so `/assets/main.css` with
no build behind it reads as build state the next `bun run build` fixes, while `/assets/typo.js`
stays a 404. `warnOnMissingDevBundles()` says the same thing at boot, and `bun run dev` builds once
before starting the watchers.

Anything that reads or writes `dist/assets` in a test must call `setAssetsDirForTest()` first.
`assets.test.ts` used to build its fixtures in the real `dist/assets` and `rmSync` the whole
directory in `afterAll` — running that one file (`bun test src/server/services/assets.test.ts`, an
editor's test button) deleted the running dev server's bundles, and every page went unstyled until
someone ran `bun run build`. Every read of the directory goes through `assetsDir()`
(`initAssets`, `handleAssetRequest`, `warnOnMissingDevBundles`, and `handleFallback`) so the
override covers all of them; pass `null` in an `afterEach`/`finally` to restore it. It is
deliberately not an env var — `--outdir ./dist/assets` is fixed in `package.json`, so pointing a
deployment somewhere else would only break boot.

### The upstream release is in `.billet-version`, not `package.json`

`package.json`'s `version` belongs to whoever forked this — `START_PROMPT.md` hands the project
name and that field over at setup. `.billet-version` is the separate, rename-proof record of which
Billet release the tree came from: one version line, everything else comment.

Read it before deciding whether a reported bug is real. A fork reporting something already fixed
upstream is the common case, and without that line the only way to tell is diffing source against a
repo the fork may not have as a remote. With it, `git log <tag>..HEAD -- <path>` settles it. There
is deliberately no script — the file's comment carries the `curl` commands for upstream's tags and
CHANGELOG, and every release documents what a fork must change under **Breaking changes**.

Bump it in the release commit, next to the `package.json` bump and the CHANGELOG entry.

### Linting

Biome runs with `recommended` on and `noConsole: error` — use `log` from
`src/server/services/logger.ts` in server code. Test files, `logger.ts`, the database CLI/seed
scripts, and `test-utils/bootstrap.ts` have targeted overrides in `biome.json`; add an override
there rather than sprinkling ignore comments.

`tsconfig.json` excludes `src/server/services/email-providers/resend.ts` from typechecking —
changes to it are not covered by `bun run check`.

### Naming that isn't inferable

App controllers export a plain name (`home`, `projects`); API controllers use an `Api` suffix
(`examplesApi`, `statsApi`) so both can be barrel-exported when they share a resource name.

## Skills

Detail lives in skills so it loads only when it's relevant:

- `adding-a-feature` — wiring a new page, API endpoint, or admin route through every layer
- `writing-tests` — the testing pattern for each module type
- `verifying-changes` — how to run checks and tests, and what the failures mean

## Runbooks

`runbooks/` holds the operational standards this project is held to — `SECURITY.md`, `PRIVACY.md`,
`ACCESSIBILITY.md`, `SEO.md`, `EMAIL.md`, `CI.md`, `TEAMS.md`. Read the relevant one before
changing headers, cookies, metadata, email delivery, or anything on the team surface.
