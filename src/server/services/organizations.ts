 * two concurrent removals of the last two owners each see the *other* owner —
 * neither has committed — so both pass the check and both commit, leaving the
 * organisation with no owner at all. Classic write
 * skew: row-level locking only serialises writes to the same row, and these
 * touch different rows.
 *
 * Locking the owner rows first closes it. The second transaction blocks on the
 * lock, and once the first commits its `FOR UPDATE` re-checks and drops the row
 * that was deleted — so it now sees one owner, fails the guard, and is refused.
 * `ORDER BY user_id` fixes the lock order so two callers can't deadlock by
 * taking the same rows in opposite orders.
 *
 * The cost is that removing a plain member also briefly locks the org's owner
 * rows, serialising unrelated changes to one org. On a team page that is
 * nothing, and the alternative is a guard that is only usually right.
