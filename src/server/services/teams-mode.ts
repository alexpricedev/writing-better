// A boolean rather than a mode string, unlike AUTH_MODE. That is a mode because
// both of its values are real behaviours and there is no "off"; this feature is
// purely additive, so it matches CAPTCHA_ENABLED instead.
//
// It does take AUTH_MODE's *fatal* validation, which CAPTCHA_ENABLED lacks:
// TEAMS_ENABLED=1 or =yes would silently 404 an entire authorisation surface,
// and an owner seeing a 404 on their own team page reads that as a bug rather
// than a mode.
//
// Read from process.env on every call (not captured at import) so tests can
// flip it between cases, matching `authMode` in auth-mode.ts and
// `captchaEnabled` in captcha.ts.
//
// Naming: the URL and the UI say "team"; the database says "org", because that
// is what the row is. The split is deliberate, not drift.
